# todo-workshop from Microsoft

## Important Notice

Unfortunately, the recommendations feature no longer works without an active API key. However, you can still see the code used for it. It was functional during the workshop.

Please note that the tasks you write in this app will be visible to anyone, as I didn't have the opportunity to finish implementing authorization. Unfortunately, the organizers promised it would work longer, but access was unexpectedly closed.
